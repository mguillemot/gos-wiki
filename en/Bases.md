When a Gang wants to use one or the territories it has within a system, it must first build a base. The starting location is important because it may have some strategic value.

## Power management and modules

The base is the nerve center of the energy management which all systems and modules work. It is very important to always make sure to have fuel in stock (and/or photocaptor) so that everything works correctly.

According to the **[[Generator]]** database it is possible to use alternative fuels to compensate for the burning rate of less refined.
